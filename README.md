# Pasteclipboard
This is for those of you that were annoyed, when you could not paste the content of your clipboard for some reason. This installs a tray icon (https://www.simple-talk.com/dotnet/.net-framework/creating-tray-applications-in-.net-a-practical-guide/) that allows you to send your clipboard to the program you select afterwards.
